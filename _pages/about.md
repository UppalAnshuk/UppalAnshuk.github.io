Hi, 
I am a PhD student at the Technical University of Denmark at the Applied Mathematics and Computer Science Department. I am supervised by [Jes Frellsen](https://frellsen.org/) at DTU and [Wouter Boomsma](https://ku-bioml.github.io/people/#wouter) at DIKU(University of Copenhagen). My research is a part of the [Centre for Basic Machine Learning Research in Life Sciences](https://www.mlls.dk/).

Prior to starting this graduate program, I was a research associate at [RBCDSAI, IIT Madras](https://rbcdsai.iitm.ac.in/) and before that I finished my integrated masters in ECE with a specialisation in signal processing and pattern recognition from [IIIT Bangalore](https://iiitb.ac.in/). During my masters, in 2019 I also spent some time in the Approximate Bayesian Inference team at [RIKEN-AIP](https://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/) in Tokyo working under [Emtiyaz Khan](https://emtiyaz.github.io/) on scaling Bayesian natural gradient optimizers.


# Research Interests 
Currently I have broad interests in the field of probabilistic modelling. I am enthusiastic about problems in Bayesian deep learning, gaussian processes and applications of generative modelling. Works that aim to quantify/estimate uncertainty, model densities, or infer underlying structures/phenomena probabilistically, intrigue me.
